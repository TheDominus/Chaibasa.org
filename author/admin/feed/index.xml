<p>The District Transport Department has imposed a total fine of 60 thousand rupees on 33 motorcycles and 2 Tata Magic drivers for violating traffic rules within two days. In Chaibasa, a motorcycle driver incurred a total loss of six thousand rupees due to lack of license and helmet.</p>



<p> On behalf of the District Transport Department, it was told that on Wednesday, by running a motorcycle investigation campaign in front of the Sadar police station, 11 motorcyclists without helmets were charged a total penalty of Rs 11 thousand. </p>



<p>Similarly, motorists were checked without a helmet in front of Mufassil police station on Tuesday. During this period, a fine of Rs 49 thousand was recovered from 22 motorcycle drivers and two Tata Magic drivers. Tata Magic was from Odisha and did not have permits here. 10–10 thousand rupees were recovered from both. </p>



<p>Here, Inspector cum Sadar police station in-charge Niranjan Tiwari said that the motorists would be constantly monitored. Most people ride their bikes without helmets. The police will keep a special watch on these. Also, youth and women below the age of 18 years will also be monitored. </p>



<p>Younger young men and women will be stopped first, after which their family members will be called and fined. Special attention will be paid to this. In most of the road accidents that are happening right now, girls learning scooty are involved, three people sit and ride while learning.</p>



<p> Police do not mean to harass anyone. Police ask people to wear helmets continuously for the safety of the motorcycle and scooty drivers. If you are wearing a helmet, then the police have no problem. Niranjan Tiwari called upon the motorcycle driver not to drive without a helmet and go safely to his home.</p>

<p>The Construction of Chaibasa Medical College was going in Ulijhari, Chaibasa at a cost of 300 crores. However, the workers stopped on Wednesday, demanding to increase the wage rate. All the working laborers gathered and started raising slogans demanding fair compensation.</p>



<p>As soon as the workers arrived in the morning to work, they started demanding the management to increase the wage rate. More than 100 workers engaged in its construction work stopped the work, raising slogans for their demand. </p>



<p>The laborer Bhimsen Devgam added in this regard that a medical college is being built, for this consent was taken from all the villagers. We are not opposing the construction of all medical colleges, we are also working in that place. But the wage rate fixed by the government should be given. At present, Rs 250 is being given to laborers and Rs 350 to mistry. While the government has fixed the wage rate at Rs 390 for laborers and Rs 630 for mistry. On this basis, the management of the medical college is not giving wages. Many times, the workers have asked the contractor to increase the wage rate but said that the rate is being given on the same basis. He added that no safety is given while working. If any incident happens to the workers somehow then who will take responsibility for it. Therefore, management helmets, shoes, and gloves should be provided to the laborers. So that construction work can be done safely. </p>



<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of the Medical College on 23 September 2018 in 25 acres of land after a lot of controversy in Ulijhari. Once the medical college is constructed, the health condition of the people of the area will improve completely. But there is controversy from time to time in the construction of a medical college. The construction of the college is to be completed in three years, in which the college and women hostels will also be constructed.</p>

<p style="text-align:left">Chaibasa bus stand is going to be renovated and a new bus stand is going to be constructed very soon. In this regard, the exercise has been started by the city council of Chaibasa.</p>



<p> This time the bus stand will be prepared as a model of Ranchi-Khadagara bus stand. On Monday 16th Sept, City Council Executive Officer Abhay Kumar Jha, Vice President of Bus Honor Association, Mohammad Bariq, and the engineer of Para Mom Consultancy Limited inspected the government bus stand and private bus stand. </p>



<p>On the spot, the executive officer told that this time both the private and government bus stands will be merged and one bus stand will be constructed that will be full of all facilities. The new bus stand will have facilities for passenger seating, two large halls, separate toilets for men and women, pure drinking water, route number for each carriage.</p>



<p>With these facilities, the passengers will know immediately from which number stand, they have to board the bus. Currently, the passengers have some difficulty in catching the bus to go to Ranchi and Tata.</p>



<p> Also, all arrangements of today&#8217;s era will be equipped, including malls, shops, guest houses for travelers, clean and beautiful restaurants. There are approximately one and a half acres of land combining both bus stands.</p>



<p> Chaibasa bus stand departs from Bihar, Bengal, Odisha and other places on a daily basis. The executive officer said that its DPR will be prepared and sent to the city development department Ranchi soon. After acceptance from there, the foundation stone will be done immediately, so that a new bus stand will be ready in 2020.</p>



<p> Earlier, Planning was going on that the Chaibasa bus stand will be constructed out of the city, but the Vice President of the Bus Honor Association, Mo. Bariq put a lot of effort so that the old bus stand will be renovated.</p>
