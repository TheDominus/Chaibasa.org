He said that the blankets that are being given to you people must use those blankets. While it is often seen that the institutions distribute blankets but people do less use. So this blanket has been given to you only. The more you use them you will be left out of the cold. On the occasion, 100 blankets were distributed by the Har-Har Mahadev Seva Sangh. On the occasion, Lalit Sharma, the outgoing president of Chaibasa Chamber, said that this blanket is being given to the needy by the Har-Har Mahadev Seva Sangh. Similarly, other institutions should also come forward and provide blankets among the needy.
