Now it will go a lot again on this day and there is a great news for the people of Chaibasa. Deputy Commissioner Arwa Rajkamal said that the budget for the first 80 lakhs was built for the restoration of Pillai Hall, but due to its lack of beauty, this budget has been increased to two crore and 15 lakhs. Mukund Rungta, director, industrialist and social worker, SR Rungta Group said that the renovation of Pillai Hall will be completed in 8 to 9 months. Twenty million and 15 million budgets have been made for the budget. If a little too much will be seen then the SR Rungta Group will not go back.
