Overall, the restoration and beautification of the added pond will take one month to start. In the meantime, if it rains, then the pond will be filled with water and the contractor will have to stop the work. It will take at least 15 days to clean it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>People will get many facilities in and around the pond.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steel railing will be constructed around the pond. Stone boulder will be applied. A three meter leaf block will be laid. Grass and plantation will be done. The chair will be seated with the block. Two rounded stairs and one straight stair will be installed in the pond. A machine will be installed to filter the water the pond of the small pond so that the filtered water could be brought to the larger pond. ETP (Effect Treatment Plant) and CETP (Common Treatment Plant) will be installed. Three big fountains will be planted with lightning in the bigger pond. Street lights will be mounted around the pond. Besides this, dustbins will be installed to avoid dirt around the pond. The grass will be planted around the pond.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a long time, the path of restoration and beautification of Joda Talab in the middle of Chaibasa city has become clear.
