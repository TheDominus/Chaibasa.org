For this, Sanitation Awareness Campaign was started on Friday in the Rungta Marwari Secondary School on behalf of the Municipal Council and Pioneer Agency. On the spot, City Manager of the City Council, Akash, made people aware of drought waste and wet waste. He said that throwing garbage around the environment is polluted. Apart from this, the possibility of spreading various kinds of diseases is always maintained. Therefore, the people of the city council area put dry and wet garbage in the trains of the city council. Everyone should keep two buckets in their homes. Drained garbage in one and putting in a garbage in one and putting it in the cart. The city will also be clean and one day nobody can stop making the city clean chaibasa and green chaibasa. Provided it requires cooperation of all. Akash said that the waste is also made from this waste which works very fertile in the fields. If the waste manure is put into the farm, the crop of the field will be seen. In this campaign every section should be accompanied. For this work, all sections should be aware and come forward. Because this city belongs to all. Not only is the town council of the city. On the occasion, a large number of schoolchildren were present on the occasion including the Pioneer agency&#8217;s Atul, TMC&#8217;s friendliness, teacher Nirmal Chandra Tripathi.<\/p>\n<p>Source :-\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.jagran.com\/jharkhand\/west-singhbhum-cleaning-abhiyaan-18699695.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jagran<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This dream will be incomplete until all of them are involved in making clean Chaibasa-green chaibasa.
